<li>It effectively limits what Scotland can leverage due to having to accept the rest of the UK's standards</li>
<li>2 main Principles<ul>
<li><strong>Mutual Recognition</strong>: A good, which complies with regulation permitting its sale in the part of the UK it is produced in or imported into, can be sold in other parts of the UK, without complying with equivalent regulation there.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Discrimination</strong>: Regulatory requirements that discriminate against a good from another part of the UK, whether directly or indirectly, will not be enforceable.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>economic growth</li>

<ul>
<li>It focuses on the programmes with the greatest potential to shift the economic dial and marks a shift in our approach to delivery.</li>

</ul>
<p>Five key programmes of action:</p>
